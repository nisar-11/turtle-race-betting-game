# Turtle Race Betting Game

## Overview
The Turtle Race Betting Game is a fun and interactive project built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. In this game, users can bet on a turtle's color to win a virtual race. Once the race starts, the turtles randomly move across the screen until one of them crosses the finish line. The program then determines whether the user won or lost their bet.

---

## Features
- **Interactive Betting:** Users can input their choice of turtle color to bet on.
- **Randomized Movements:** Each turtle moves a random distance on every iteration, making the race unpredictable.
- **Win/Loss Notification:** The program displays a message based on whether the userâ€™s bet was correct.
